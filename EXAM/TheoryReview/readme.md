# What is and what is not
This theory review is:
- a little review/summary of the most important topics needed for exercises
- an effective way (I hope) to rapidly review concepts near the exam

This is not:
- a full summary that substitutes theory notes (maybe there aren't all the topics) 
- an ensemble of notes that **alone** allows you to pass the exam
