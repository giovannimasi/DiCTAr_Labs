# How to navigate these folders


The folders structure is set up for my personal convenience ;)   

If you try to run the code, it might not find everything 
immediately because some files are likely in different 
locations. I won't update the paths until I re-run 
the code (prob never), so you might need to 
tweak things manually. It's not a maze though, I'm sure you 
guys can figure it out.

Moreover, you'll maybe find errors / different data / results. Just don't try to fix your codes in function of mine; mistakes can occur 
or simply I could edit just for the meme some ex.

Hope you'd read it before starting navigate and running scripts.
