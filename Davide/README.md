# Dictar repo
👋 **About Me**

My name is Davide, a Mechatronics Engineering student with a strong passion for everything related to Control Systems.

📂 **What is this repo?**

This repository contains a collection of materials I developed during the course, including:

- Lecture examples 
- Laboratories
- Bit of theory
- Bit of exam preparation

The goal of this project is to provide a helpful reference for fellow students tackling this subject.

> [!WARNING]
> **Disclaimer**: while I have put some effort into this repo, please note that it is not perfect. Errors may occur, and this repository should not be considered
 a definitive guide for the theoretical aspects of the Dictar course. I recommend 
using these materials primarily to integrate and verify your own exercises and labs.

If you spot any bugs or inaccuracies, please let me know via email (s353121) (or your preferred contact).

### Need More Help?

If you are looking for more comprehensive resources, I offer the following:

📝 **Dictar Masterclass**

I have developed a private Notion workspace that explains the entire course slide-by-slide, breaking down complex theoretical concepts.
In addition to this, I've built the perfect collection of exercises for exam preparation, 
based on proposed exercises and labs, exam simulations and databases, AI generated quizzes and exercises.

As you can imagine, this work is not free, if you are interested contact me!

👨‍🏫 **Private Tutoring**

If you are struggling with the course — whether it's the theoretical understanding or the practical implementation — I offer private lessons tailored to your needs.

Again feel free to reach out to me via email to discuss details!
