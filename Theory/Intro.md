# Introduction
## Discrete Time Dynamical Systems (DTDS)
A discrete time dynamical systems are dynamics systems that describes  
1. phenomena whose events are described in DT instants only (e.g. one event / a year)
2. sampled continuous time dynamical systems 
    
DTDS can be described by a state space representation of this form
